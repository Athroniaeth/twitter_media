# Project Overview

This project aims to
leverage HuggingFace's Mistral model to create an efficient and intelligent pipeline for managing Twitter content. The primary functionalities include generating tweets from URLs, creating articles
with optimized metadata, monitoring and reposting trending tweets, and utilizing a database for storing and retrieving tweet data to enhance future content.

## Objectives

### Pipeline System with HuggingFace and Mistral

* Task: Develop a non-local pipeline utilizing HuggingFace's Mistral model.
* Functionality: Input a URL to generate a tweet.
    * Steps: Simplify the information from the URL to highlight the most important points. Use a text generation model to create a JSON object representing the tweet. Output the content of the
      generated tweet.

### Article Creation System

* Task: Create a system to generate articles from existing ones.
* Purpose: Modify web page metadata for enhanced display on tweets.
    * Steps: Extract and analyze content from the source article. Generate a new article with optimized metadata for social media sharing. Ensure the new article provides a superior visual
      representation when tweeted.

### Monitoring and Reposting Trending Tweets

* Task: Implement a system to browse and analyze a list of tweets.
* Functionality: Identify and repost trending tweets, especially those related to global news.
    * Steps: Monitor tweets from a predefined list of accounts. Identify tweets that are gaining significant traction. Repost content from trending tweets if they pertain to global news.

### Database for Tweet Storage and Retrieval

* Task: Store tweets in a database for future use.
* Functionality: Use stored tweets as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to provide context for new tweets.
    * Steps: Store tweets from a list of monitored accounts in a database. Utilize the database to enhance the context and relevance of future tweets. Periodically evaluate the usage of stored data.
      Delete data that is rarely utilized or does not contribute to trending content.

## Conclusion

This roadmap outlines the development of a sophisticated Twitter content management system leveraging HuggingFace's Mistral model. The project focuses on efficient content generation, metadata
optimization, trend monitoring, and intelligent data storage to enhance social media engagement and content relevance.
